MethylationHMM
******
This repository contains the HMM implementation for decoding CpG sites methylation states. This project is based on the [`fmorenopino's HeterogeneousHMM <https://github.com/fmorenopino/HeterogeneousHMM#>`_] python implementation with minor adjustments that adopts the HMM to read counts based genomic data.
